Compute Engine Creation with "static ip address":

How to Reserve static ip address:

static ip address can be assigned for any compute engine instance, usually whenever compute 
engine restarts it will be assigned new ip address every time. 
This can lead to issues to clients who are accessing, they need to update their ip address
every time compute engine restarts.

Having static ip address created and assigned to compute engine instance, will resolve the issue
Once we assign static ip address, even though compute engine instance restarts ip address will not change,
it will still use new static ip address created

Note: At a time only one static ip address can be assigned to one compute engine instance

To Create New Reserve Static IP Address ->

Go to VPC Network -> IP Address -> Click on "RESERVE EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS" -> Create

"RESERVE EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS" -> are of two types
1. Regional -> when we select regional this will be or can be assigned to only 
compute engine instance
2. Global -> this is for load balancer (need to update this section when load balancer is covered)

Questions: Can we only reserve only static ip address for external IP? can we have 
static ip address for internal ip address?
