1. Go To Compute Engine -> Create Instance with following options

instance name, region, zone, machine configuration, machine type, available policies, enable display device (choose defaults)

For the Identity & API Access Section,

Allow default access, Firewall -> Select Allow HTTP Traffic, Compute Engine is created

2. What is Service Account:

To Access any Resource in GCP we need to have account that can be either service account or user account.

User Account is different from Service Account, user account can only be used to access or create resources in gcp 

In case of Service Account, if you want to have communication between two gcp resources like gcp compute engine and gcp container registry, 
we need to have service account created

Service Account will be identified with email address and key Firewall

3. Create Service Account: Goto IAM & ADMIN -> create service account, next add role to the service account

What is role in service account: roles are access/granted to access gcp resources

Example: 

4. Login Into Compute Engine by using gcloud command

Docker has to be installed in compute engine

Install Docker on your new Google Compute Engine Machine:
Login as super user
sudo -s
Run the following command to install docker
sudo apt-get install docker.io
Docker is now ready!
Test docker
docker ps

After Successfull installation, now we have to pull gcr image in compute engine 
with below command

docker pull gcr.io/carbon-dev-392917/test-project:1.0

if you see authentication issue, then you should login with service account which has
role to access it

gcloud auth activate-service-account ACCOUNT --key-file=KEY-FILE //associate ur details
gcloud auth activate-service-account service-account-test@carbon-dev-392917.iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=carbon-dev-392917-17c31c048943.json

//create service account(key should be always selected as json) from gcp console and download keyfile
 it ur local machine and push to the compute engine instance(by using google ssh in browser)

//once you see authnetication issue, run the following command
gcloud auth configure-docker -> this command will allow docker to interact with gcp

Now image will be pulled successfully in compute engine instance

5. Run Docker Image in GCP Compute Engine Instance

docker run -p8080:8080 gcr.io/carbon-dev-392917/test-project:1.0

Docker will run container successfully, you can see it via docker ps
